Poyang Lake located in Jiangxi Province is the largest freshwater lake in China. Its wetland ecosystem has a significant impact on the change of China's environment [1]. The lake provides a habitat for a great number of migratory birds, and is a favorite destination for birding. It is fed by the Gan and Xiu Rivers, which connect to the Yangtse through a channel [2].
