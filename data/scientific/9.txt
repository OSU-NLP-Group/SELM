As proposed in this paper, a scenario of a conceptual search can be illustrated by a user consulting a system, indicating the concept that he or she wants to research about. The determination of this concept can be done: (i) in an explicit way, in which the user indicates which concept of an ontology he or she is interested in to search; or (ii) in an implicit way, in which the concept searched and the ontology are determined by natural language analyzers and reasoners. These ontologies are obtained in an ontology repository. The implicit form is beyond the scope of this work. Still at the moment of the search, the user may also choose a level of similarity, represented by a value between 0 and 1, that he or she allows to be used in the answer provided (or this value may be intrinsic to the system).
