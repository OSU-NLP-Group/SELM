The complete group of the Hamiltonian is the combination of all these possible symmetries. This derivation is directly evident from the mathematical form of the Hamiltonian and expresses fundamental properties of molecular space and time. Yet it took 40 years, from Schrodinger to Longuet-Higgins, to obtain a clear definition of the molecular-symmetry group. Three kinds of symmetries may be identified:
