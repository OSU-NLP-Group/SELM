Gemma Flanagan rolled herself down the catwalk for the first time at a London fashion event on Wednesday.
"It was so amazing to do it and not fall off. My biggest worry was I'd roll off the end or the side," she said.
Before an illness left her unable to walk, she worked as an air hostess and part-time model.
"I surprisingly felt just as confident as I have done in the past which, considering it was the first one in my chair, I wasn't sure how I'd cope with.
"When you're walking you can kind of have a little strut and do your thing. That's what I was worried about - not being able to show the clothes off as well.
"The designer's just so pleased with how I showcased their items and at the end of the day that's what modelling's about."
The fashion show was planned by the group Models of Diversity which campaigns for the fashion and beauty industries to represent diversity, and took place at the Ideal Home Show in London's Olympia.
Gemma, who is celebrating her 32nd birthday this week, wants using disabled models to be the norm.
"The more people that are open to using models with disabilities then the more people will see it as normal.
"We've all been in campaigns that have been a one-off for companies and a lot of them aren't paid either.
"It would be good to use models with disabilities just as models, not as one-offs - we're better than that," she says.
As for her future, she says: "I've got a hair show in May and a couple of shoots lined up with local photographers.
"I want to do a lot more using my chair. I'm in it near enough all of the time now. Part of me doing this show was to embrace myself and embrace the fact that the chair isn't the enemy anymore.
"It's basically seeing past the metal and the wheels and just saying, 'that's a gorgeous model' rather than 'a girl in a chair'."
In 2011 Gemma was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome, a serious condition which affects the nervous system.
She spent seven months in rehab trying to learn to speak, write and walk again.
Recently though she says she's found it harder to walk with crutches and has become increasingly reliant on her wheelchair.
"When I got ill they were hoping I'd make a full recovery," she said.
"But I've started getting worse again and the consultant thinks this may be the best I'm ever going to be.
"I've been a bit up and down, but now I feel OK mostly.
"I want to show other people they don't need to be defined by their disabilities."

But there are some more upbeat aspects of their assessment. They don't reject the idea that this might just be a temporary soft patch.
And they say emerging economies are not as vulnerable as they were in previous decades.
The starting point for this report is the marked slowdown in growth that has already taken place in the emerging market economies since 2010.
They have grown more slowly than the five years before the international financial crisis. By last year, the growth rate had slipped below the long-term average.
China is the most high-profile example and in a way it's a special case. A slowdown there was seen as inevitable after three decade of rapid economic expansion.
But many others in this group have also seen their performance weaken including Brazil, Russia and South Africa. (India is something of an exception.)
Their slowdown contrasts with a weak but steady recovery in the advanced economies.
The central question posed by the report is whether this is a temporary problem or the beginning of a new era of slower growth.
There is no definitive answer in this report, but there is a clear sense of unease that it might be the latter, less attractive of the two possibilities.
Some of the factors behind the slowdown are likely to be persistent. Many are affected by sliding prices of commodities such as metals and oil. There has also been weaker demand in export markets for their products, which in turn partly reflects what the report calls "anaemic growth in the advanced economies".
International trade is likely to stay weak as the rich countries' recovery remains hesitant. Large investments in commodity production in recent years are likely to mean strong supplies which will keep downward pressure on prices.
Some, especially oil exporters, have seen a deterioration in government finances as tax revenue has fallen sharply.
There also been a marked decline in foreign investment going into emerging economies. It fell by about a quarter between 2010 and 2014. In the first part of 2015 there was a marked increase in capital leaving the emerging economies.
There are also domestic factors, including aging populations in many emerging economies.  The growth in productivity - the amount that each worker produces - has slowed in many.
The report describes the slowdown as "unusually synchronous (affecting many countries at the same time) and protracted".
Looking, ahead the report notes the prospect of higher borrowing costs as the US Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates - widely expected to begin as soon as next week.
That is likely to lead also to a stronger dollar. That makes money borrowed in dollars more expensive to repay and the amount of foreign currency debt has increased from 30% of emerging economies' national income in 2007 to 36% last year.
Declining currencies could also cause an inflation problem - they make imports more costly.
There are clearly some reasons to be concerned. But the World Bank's economists also emphasise how these countries have changed compared with the 1980s and 90s.
They have reduced debt and inflation levels, diversified their economies (they are less dependent on specific industries and so less in danger if those industries get into difficulty). And they have improved their economic policies.
What should they do? There is no one-size-fits-all. Those who can afford to spend more on infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, energy) would benefit from doing so.
There's a call for continued efforts to improve the climate for business, make labour markets more effective, tackle corruption and improve the efficiency of government.  Much of this is frankly advice the Bank would give to most countries most of the time.
So no hard conclusions here.  More of a warning; a call for economic vigilance.Mark Duffus, 41, from Forres in Moray, was among at least seven people who died in a suicide attack on the Kabul base of a logistics firm supplying Nato forces in Afghanistan.
He was employed by international security management group Blue Hackle.
Five guards, four of them Nepali, were among those killed in the gun and bomb attack, which happened early on Tuesday.
In his profile on the LinkedIn social media website, Mr Duffus said he had been employed by Blue Hackle since 2005, and was working as a site security manager.
He had previously served in the armed forces for nine years.
The Kabul police chief told the BBC the four insurgents, who were all killed, had a truck full of explosives.
Smoke was seen rising above the scene of the attack in the north of the city.
Reports suggested the bombers' vehicle was stopped outside the facility by guards.
When the explosives were detonated, gunmen began shooting at guards in a 30-minute battle, officials said.
As well as the Nepali guards, two Afghan truck drivers who were waiting to enter the compound were killed and an Afghan guard.
Kabul police chief Gen Ayub Salangi said all four attackers were killed and the blast from the truck left a large crater in the ground.
This is the latest in a series of attacks on targets in the Afghan capital in recent months.
Moray SNP MP Angus Robertson said: "The loss of anybody whether military or civilian in a conflict is terrible for their family, friends and the wider community.
"My sympathies are very much with those family and friends in Forres and elsewhere at this sad time."However, the first of the Seattle bands which made up the grunge music scene - a fusion of punk, indie and rock - Soundgarden, released their most successful album, Superunknown, that year.
The Grammy-winning album produced the hit singles Black Hole Sun and Spoonman, and helped the band achieve worldwide sales of more than 20 million records.
The re-mastered digital version of the album will be released this year to mark its 20th anniversary of release. The group, which reformed in 2010 after a 13-year hiatus, also played the album in its entirety for the first time at the iTunes festival in Austin, Texas, last month.
"We were touring at the time of Kurt's death," lead singer Chris Cornell recalls, "and we just came off stage to be told of the reports that they had found Kurt, and he was dead.
"We were very emotional. All of the bands in Seattle had grown up together, we were all friends. I wanted to deny it, I didn't want to believe it was true. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to hear."
Guitarist Kim Thayil adds: "In some ways, I agree, grunge was already coming to an end at the time of Kurt's death.
"Sure, we released Superunknown that year, but all of us, the successful grunge bands, had left Seattle and were endlessly on the road. In the meantime the city was full of musicians moving there, wanting to make it in the industry. It was like LA during the '80s, the Sunset strip and hair metal. It had lost its vibe."
In the past, Cornell has described Soundgarden, who formed in 1984, as "the band that created the soundtrack" for grunge music.
Out of all the groups that formed in Seattle in the late 1980s - most famously, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Mudhoney - they were the first to sign to a mainstream label. But it was the release of Nirvana's Nevermind album, in September 1991, which put the city, and its then-unique style of music, on the musical map.
"I don't think there ever can be those conditions in the industry again to produce something like the Seattle band scene, of which Nirvana were the cultural event," he says.
"Seattle was an isolated and provincial place that was left alone for years to develop its musical scene. None of us had overnight success, it's not like suddenly one day Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam all formed.
"It all changed after Nevermind, it became commercialised. Everyone wanted to discover the next big thing."
"I don't think the grunge movement was actually original," continues Thayil.
"It was just a a synthesis of different underground music genres. What made it original was the kind of people doing it - it was our extreme youth. I think most of us were trying to fit in with the rock scene in the city, but because we were also fans of darker music - British bands like Joy Division, Killing Joke, Bauhaus, The Smiths - our shows reached a whole other audience of kids.
"All of us in these bands were influencing each other, I think that was our secret to developing the sound. We were all watching what the other bands were doing, there was a real friendly rivalry between us all.
"We all borrowed from Nirvana, but they also borrowed from us. It became something electric in Seattle and it felt great to be influential for a moment in time."
Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron agrees: "The success of Nevermind took everyone by surprise."
"Of course, Kurt was a very special frontman, anyone could see the rapport between him and his audience - but no-one could ever have predicted that album would sell 30 million copies.
"And again, this couldn't happen again in the digital age because kids would already have been file sharing, but also, social media would have built a hype. What happened with the grunge movement was organic, and I wonder if that will be the last time that can happen in the music industry.
"Certainly I'm not sure there'll ever be a regional music movement again, and I don't think the next big thing in music will involve guitars - right now rock has lost its place at the centre of music."
After Soundgarden's split, Chris Cornell went on to form supergroup Audioslave, with members of Rage Against the Machine. Soundgarden's reformation in 2010 led to the hit album King Animal in 2012, but they have returned, Matt Cameron insists, to "a different world".
"Think about it," he says. "We've been invited to something called the iTunes festival, which is one of the biggest brands in music, and didn't exist before, and Lady Gaga is hanging around Austin, Texas, at what was once a little event for alternative music called SXSW. Our concert is being streamed live to millions of people, it's a strange concept to us. But it's humbling to have produced one album at least that still resonates after two decades.
"We released Superunknown a month before Kurt's death. You know, if you were part of the Seattle scene you were soldiers in the field. We enjoyed a lot of success but we all lost a lot too, and Kurt is the biggest example of that. Those of us who are left are friends for life.
"Dave Grohl is a great friend of ours still, he directed a recent music video for us, and he's turning into a very talented filmmaker too."
It's the loss of the talent of Kurt Cobain that Chris Cornell argues is the most difficult to deal with.
"To have all that promise snatched away, to think of all the things he could have been creating now. The possibilities were just so great."
The re-mastered edition of Superunknown by Soundgarden will be released in the UK in June 2014.The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an
