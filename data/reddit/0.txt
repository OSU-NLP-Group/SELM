Watching Alexi Laiho from Children of Bodom play. I was a metal head for a long time and one day I was just watching stuff on the web (I don't think I knew of or youtube was a thing back then, been playing over 10 years) he did like various instructional videos. I was just like "I want to be able to do that", if anything though learning the instrument has branched out my musical tastes to more than just metal.
