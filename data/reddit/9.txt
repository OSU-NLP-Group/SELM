I believe "Our" purpose as a species is to seek truth. Connect the dots and understand why what is, is. Is our universe one of many? is it a cell living within something far bigger than us? (very cool idea a friend of mine was talking about) in our life times, we may never know these answers, but we can lay down the ground works. As a collective, as a species I believe Our purpose is finding answers. We've become an Intellectual species, with natural curiosities, every child I've met has always asked "why?" 
 As an individual I believe our purpose is one of support for one another, helping everyone achieve their best. In a sense, helping everyone be happy. I've met many individuals with PTSD, Bi-polar, and other various mental disorders, many I've met all had dreams, things they wanted to pursue in order to be happy in life, but walked away from because of how they felt, because the social stigma of saying "I'm not ok." I believe if the individual can be happy in life, they can contribute in a small or big way to helping us all understand the questions around us.
