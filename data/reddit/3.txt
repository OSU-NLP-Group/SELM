He's now a "consultant" for Ambit energy. Simply typing the search term "ambit" in to google and the third suggestion down is "ambit energy scam". My dad made an investment of $400 and pays $30 a month for a page on ambit's website. He told me in confidence that he gets $100 for every 5 people that sign up and that the real money is in the residuals he will receive if he gets other people to work for them. 
 This worries me because my dad has already lost a lot of money on really stupid investments. He is pretty much the sole provider for our family, my mom makes money but hardly any and she's pretty much burying her head in the sand on this one. I'm just worried about crushing his pride and sending him into another depression/alcohol binge. 
 I am 20 and he's 50. He calls me retarded and stupid all the time while he thinks he's a genius. I want to tell him its a scam and save him the hurt in his wallet but knowing my dad I could see him hyper-concentrating on it to earn money and proove me wrong and constantly bring it up every single day.
