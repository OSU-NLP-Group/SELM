It's like time travel, isn't it? I know how it is, I used to work for the university of Vienna, which was established 1365 and the last time we updated procedures was apparently after the second siege of Vienna by the Ottoman Empire. 
 The only way to get mail to a certain department which was nestled within the department of Egyptian studies like some sort of academic lamprey was to by taking it there. On foot. Why? Because they didn't have a letterbox. And why didn't they have one? Because they adhered to some original part of the academic code when everything was housed in a single building instead of 50+ buildings erratically scattered all over the city. And why did they still adhere to this? Because they were overlooked when the post box licenses where handed out. In 1897. The last time you needed a license to own a letterbox was before the fall of the old empire in 1918. So why not mail it to the (comparatively) modern department of egyptian studies? Because all the mail gets delivered to the main building and library, four streets away, as the office in question and main building have seperate physical adresses, but the same mailing adress. The postal code is from a time when your mailman knew you by first and last name in an area that now houses 1.75 million people. 
 So you walk. Or rather, go two stops by tram, and then walk up six flights of stairs. To find out they're not there. But it wasn't possible to call them ahead of time. Because they have no telephone. I never found out why, I was too busy experiencing existential ennui to bother.
