Long Story Short: I'm starting a new campaign of a kick ass game, Houses of the Blooded. I've been re-reading Dune, and also more recently S.M. Stirling's In the Courts of the Crimson Kings, so I've been all into desert style settings. 
 As I was writing the long intro for the game I had an ice water down the neck moment. I checked one of my player's LJ and sure enough, the campaign he just started in for the same game is a desert setting. DOH! 
 I don't want to compete with him and want to do something original. The characters are all playing young nobles and the themes for my game are: a rising merchant class, piracy, social castes, intrigue, Technology is almost 100% Organic, and possibly the discovery of a 'New World'. Airships and mountainous archipelago's could work, or some such, but I'm not sure. 
 Please Help me Out!
