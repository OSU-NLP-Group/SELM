Commenting here for visibility, unrelated to Dirt 3(although I agree it's an amazing game with shit DLC): 
 Just tried Grid 2. In its own right, the game is fun, however, if you were looking for something along the lines of sim-racing, look elsewhere. It is INCREDIBLY arcade-y. From the gameplay footage and the first Grid, I expected better driving physics than this. There isn't a cockpit view. Indy cars drift. All cars drift. I use a Fanatec racing wheel, and it just feels like I'm playing those racing games at Chuck-e-cheese. 
 Unless I missed some type of option in the menu, I can't recommend this game for anyone who's looking for a racing game with the same feel as Dirt3 or NFS:Shift2. If you're not looking for a simracer, then get the game, it's tons of non-serious fun.
