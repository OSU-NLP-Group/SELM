A ton of detail to follow, because the situation is strange. But please help-- I am open to suggestion because i'm tired of wishing that i have a shot with girls. i know i can do better because i am better. 
 I'm a college student. I've known this girl since i've been at school because I'm a swimmer and she's a diver here. She dated one of the older guys on my team for the first couple years i was here but has been single since then. The attraction for me has always been there, but because of a bro code our team adheres to she has been "off limits". But its been long enough that the bro code doesn't apply, and this girl is a  10  (defined by me as a 9, plus 1 for an x factor). She is short, blonde, stunning, constantly smiling, and (x factor) also has big boobs. She's known me this whole time as a friend of her x boyfriend, but lately since i've had a class with her we have had some deeper talks. On my end, i can say with confidence that i am an attractive person--smart, really tall, really fit, and funny. All i want is guidance on how to shift the power. she is used to guys either drooling over themselves or completely ignoring her bc of her ex boyfriend. The question--  how do i get her out of her comfort zone with me and build attraction on the low key?  other teammates can't know yet that i am try to build this relationship. i suck mainly at texting, and being forward when i need to be. but i know i have the ability to be whatever i have to be to get this girl. i just want a starting point from you guys
