Causes of Back Pain

Lower back pain can occur in people who are overweight, in poor physical shape, have poor posture, or are compelled to sit or stand for long periods of time. Muscle strain is another cause of a troubled back, either from lifting something that is too heavy or by lifting objects incorrectly. Many pregnant women develop lower back pain due to the extra weight they support during pregnancy.

Another common cause is osteoarthritis (a ”wear-and-tear” condition), fractured vertebrae (the literal "broken back"), and the “slipped” or herniated discs are all serious medical conditions that must be treated by a qualified physician.
