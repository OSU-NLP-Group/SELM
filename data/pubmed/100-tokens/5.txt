In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to clarify the nature of some interactions between Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and rodent host cells. Videomicroscopic observations were made on in vitro interactions between sporozoites and cultured host cells (rodent peritoneal macrophages, W138 human lung fibroblasts, and HepG2 human hepatoma cells). The results showed a diversity of dynamic interactions and sporozoite activities, including active sporozoite penetration,
