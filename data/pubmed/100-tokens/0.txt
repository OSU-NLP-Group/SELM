The pharmacokinetics of Casodex have been investigated in patients with prostatic carcinoma following single oral doses of 10 mg, 30 mg and 50 mg and during daily administration at these dose levels. Casodex displays prolonged absorption following a single dose, with peak plasma concentrations observed at up to 8 h for doses of 10 mg and 30 mg and up to 48 h for the 50 mg dose. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased linearly with dose, and Casodex was
