Our previous experiments (14) (15) dealt with the dynamic of the fluid-coagulant equilibrium in rats after exposure to confinement hypokinesia (CHK) at different time intervals, 1, 3, 7, 21, 28 and 35 days. We found a decreased Quiq and Howell time (QT and HT) in some relation with the time of exposure, with a tendency to normalization after 21 days. The same evolution was shown by the number of thromb
